This repository contains scripts, configurations, and documentation related to the migration of a large Splunk SmartStore cluster (50+ indexers and associated data) from one Amazon S3 SmartStore cloud environment to a new one. The primary focus is on automating and documenting the data transfer and infrastructure setup processes for efficiency and clarity.
